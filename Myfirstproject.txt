Hello, My name is Arnaud. 
I live in Etoy, near Lausanne and I have a 3-year old son with my spouse. 
I am broker on commodity derivatives markets. Therefore, I spend my days with numbers, prices and graphs, and I like it. 
I collect my own figures and stats on prices, crops, consumption, etc...and I making statistical analysis with it in order to give trading recommandations
However, my experience in coding is weak; In the past, I did a few VBA programs to automate tasks and recently, I followed small courses on Python mainly, on various MOOCs.
