Hello, My name is Arnaud. 
I live in Etoy, near Lausanne and I have a 3-year old son with my spouse. 
I am broker on commodity derivatives markets, mainly on agricultural products. Therefore, I spend my days with numbers, prices and graphs, and I like it! 
I collect my own figures and stats on prices, crops, consumption, etc...and I make statistical analysis with it in order to give trading recommandations
However, my experience in coding is weak but I am really eager to learn. In the past, I did a few VBA programs to automate tasks and recently, I followed small courses on Python mainly, on various MOOCs.

After months of intense thinking, I have decided to follow the EPFL course. Indeed, it fits with my need to focus on Python (it is very popular among companies), the quality looks high and I like the idea of a strong capstone project followed by professors. 
My ambition is to use the knowledge of this course to:
1) to model and forecast commodity prices, production, consumption, etc... 
2) to get the tools to manage the large quantity of datas produced in commodity trading house (logistic, stocks, operations). 
3) to get the basics which will allow me to build my own algo trading - coding languages

I am looking forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,

Arnaud
